### Developing a Component-based application with Angular 1.5 and Angular 2.0
### develop quality applications, faster
In your first Angular project, the framework helped you quickly create an HTML5 app. But you now face new challenges as the UI complexity increases and more code moves to the front-end. The workshop shares Patterns and Best Practices on how to structure and implement complex, real-world Angular apps

#ABSTRACT
In your first Angular project, you have experienced first hand how Angular lets developers from any background quickly create HTML5 apps. 
However, as the UI complexity increases and more code moves to the front-end, you face new challenges such as how to manage huge 
Controllers, avoid application fragility and increase code reuse. In the workshop, Carlo shares his experience in developing 
several large scale Angular applications in the last two years, and proposes Patterns and Best Practices on how to structure 
and implement complex, real-world Angular apps with a Component-based approach.




##AUDIENCE
AngularJS Developers who master the basics of the framework and would like to learn an effective approach to design and implement complex real-world Angular applications in a robust, modular and future-proof way




##PREREQUISITES
* Practical experience in Javascript and AngularJS development (you should be able to write/compile/test/debug by yourself an AngularJS 1.x application including Data Binding, Controllers and Services).
* Working knowledge of AngularJS syntax, Controllers and Services is required as these topics will NOT be explained in the workshop.
*  Knowledge of AngularJS Directive is useful, but not required.
* Basic knowledge of HTML5 and of the DOM.



##HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
* Participants are required to bring their own laptop. The labs require an HTML5 Browser (Chrome or Firefox), text editor or IDE, supporting HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.

* Modern Browser (Chrome - Firefox)

Text Editor (Sublime, Atom, Visual Studio Code,...) 
* http://brackets.io/
* http://atom.io

and/or IDE (Eclipse,  NetBeans, Intellij, Visual Studio,.. )
* http://www.eclipse.org
* http://netbeans.org
* WebStorms / Visual Studio Community

* ``python -m SimpleHTTPServer`` vs https://code.google.com/p/mongoose/



#TOPICS
* How does our code become unmanageable? A practical example
* Issues and challenges in developing complex / large HTML5 applications
* From huge controllers and “scope soup” to Component-based Uis
* How to identify application Components
* How to develop a simple Component in Angular 1.5
* Adding inputs to the Component through bindings
* Returning outputs through events and callbacks
* Lifecycle callbacks



#TOPICS 
* How to interconnect multiple collaborating Components to achieve complex UI interactions
* “Smart”, “dumb” and “stateless” components
* When to use two-way DataBinding and when One-Way Data Flow
* refactoring
* From AngularJS 1.5 to Angular 2.0: syntax changes, but Component-based architecture remains
* How to incrementally upgrade an application from 1.5 to 2.0 with ng-upgrade
* Sidenote: performance tips

A final lab will demonstrate porting the application to Angular 2.0.



##Approach
For each module, hands-on lab will include
- quizzes (which of these variants is better? trade-offs)
- interactive examples to complete and modify in an online IDE
